# Tracing-Table-Generator
A small program for generating tracing tables for Java programs, formatted for OSU students in Software 1 (CSE 2221).

## Disclaimer
#### This does not work with the `++` incrementor, yet.
This program is only intended for students that have a firm understanding of how to trace loops and should not be used to cheat on homework, tests, or other assignments. This program is meant to be a method to format and check work and the owner does not support the use of this program for any activity that may be considered academic misconduct.


## Usage

Take the loop that you are tracing and put it in the code.java file. Run the `generator.py`  script (requires python). This will make a window appear in your web browser containing the tracing table.

## Features Coming Soon
- Support for more datatypes
- GUI Application
- Support for other languages
